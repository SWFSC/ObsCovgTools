obscov4CV
==============================================================

Description

Uses simulation to estimate observer coverage required to achieve a target bycatch estimation CV (coefficient of variation), given bycatch rate, negative binomial dispersion parameter, and total fishery effort. Allows specification of probability of achieving target CV. Produces recommended minimum observer coverage to achieve target CV for bycatch estimation, and plots of (1) CV vs observer coverage, with shaded percentiles showing distribution of CVs associated with each observer coverage level, and (2) probability of zero (observed and total) bycatch vs observer coverage.
