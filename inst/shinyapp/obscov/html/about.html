The observer coverage simulator is based on the ObsCovgTools R package. 
ObsCovgTools estimates observer coverage required to achieve a specific 
objective, given mean bycatch rate, negative binomial dispersion index 
(characterizing variance in the bycatch rate), and total fishery effort in 
user-defined units (e.g., trips, sets, or hooks). Currently, potential 
objectives implemented are (1) a target probability of observing a bycatch 
event (given that it occurred in total effort), and (2) a target bycatch 
estimation CV (coefficient of variation). Probability of observing at least one 
bycatch event, and of any bycatch occurring in a given amount of total effort, 
is based on the corresponding Poisson or negative binomial probability mass 
function. Bycatch estimation CVs are based on simulated bycatch in total and 
observed effort.

<h4>
Caveat
</h4>
<p>
The current implementation of ObsCovgTools assumes observer coverage is 
representative of the fishery, and does not account for hierarchical sources of 
variance (e.g., vessel- or trip-level variation). Violating these assumptions 
will likely to result negatively biased projections of observer coverage 
required to meet specific objectives. More conservative estimates can be 
obtained by using higher-level units of effort (e.g., mean bycatch per trip 
instead of bycatch per set/haul, and number of trips instead of number of 
sets/hauls).
