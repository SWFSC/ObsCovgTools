### Description

ObsCovgTools provides tools for evaluating fishery observer coverage, particularly with respect to documenting and estimating rare bycatch. Current functionality includes evaluating observer coverage in terms of 

(1) probabilities of observing a bycatch event and of any bycatch occurring in total effort, given mean bycatch rate, dispersion index (variance to mean ratio in the bycatch rate), and total fishery effort; 
(2) upper confidence limit of bycatch when none was observed, given total fishery effort and dispersion index; and
(3) bycatch estimation CV (coefficient of variation), given bycatch rate, dispersion index, and total fishery effort. 

Estimates in all cases are based directly on the corresponding Poisson or negative binomial probability distribution.

### Caveat

The ObsCovgTools package assumes that 

* observer coverage is representative, 
* bycatch is in terms of individuals (not weight) per unit effort, and 
* the specified dispersion index reflects the highest level of any hierarchical variance (e.g., using dispersion index at trip level if greater than that at set level). 

Violating these assumptions may result in negatively biased projections of observer coverage required to meet specific objectives. Users may want to explore uncertainty in dispersion index and in bycatch per unit effort by varying those inputs.

### Shiny app

This package has been implemented as a Shiny web application, coauthored by 
Howard Coleman, which can be accessed at https://connect.fisheries.noaa.gov/ObsCovg/

(If you encounter an error at that link, you can also try https://kacurtis.shinyapps.io/obscov/)

### Installation

You can install or update {ObsCovgTools} from [GitHub](https://github.com/kacurtis/ObsCovgTools) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pkg_install("kacurtis/ObsCovgTools")
```
