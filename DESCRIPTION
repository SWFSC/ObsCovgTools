Description: Uses simulation to estimate observer coverage required to achieve
  a target bycatch estimation CV (coefficient of variation), given bycatch rate, 
  negative binomial dispersion parameter, and total fishery effort. Simulated 
  bycatch estimates use a simple mean-per-unit approach with finite population 
  correction.Allows specification of probability of achieving target CV. Produces 
  recommended minimum observer coverage to achieve target CV for bycatch estimation, 
  and plots of (1) CV vs observer coverage, with shaded percentiles showing 
  distribution of CVs associated with each observer coverage level, and (2) 
  probability of zero (observed and total) bycatch vs observer coverage.
