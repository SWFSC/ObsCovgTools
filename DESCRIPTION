Description: Estimates observer coverage required to achieve a specific
  objective, given bycatch rate, negative binomial dispersion parameter, and
  total fishery effort. Currently, potential objectives implemented are 
  (1) target probability of observing a bycatch event (given that it occurred in 
  total effort), and (2) target bycatch estimation CV (coefficient of variation). 
  The user can also specify the desired probability of achieving the target CV. 
  Probability of observing a bycatch event is based on the corresponding Poisson
  or negative binomial probability distribution function. Bycatch estimation CV 
  is based on simulated mean-per-unit bycatch estimates with finite population 
  correction, which assume representative observer coverage. CV estimates exclude 
  simulations with zero observed bycatch.
