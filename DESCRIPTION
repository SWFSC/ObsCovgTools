Description: Tools for evaluating observer coverage with respect to documenting
  and estimating rare bycatch, including (1) probabilities of observing a 
  bycatch event and of one occurring in total effort, (2) upper confidence limit 
  for bycatch given none was observed, and (3) bycatch estimation CV 
  (coefficient of variation).
